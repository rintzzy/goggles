# Goggles : a CSS custom button toolkit

<p>Button is a UI/UX component which enhance the total viewing experience to the user. It doesn't matter what you're designing, a button pretty much exists everywhere.</p>
<p>As a designer, you already have frameworks like <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>, <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com">Foundation</a> or <a href="http://getuikit.com">UIKit</a>. 
Although they do have some sort of custom button, but your choice is limited.</p>
<p>As alternative, your first thought would be using Photoshopped or vector images on buttons. But in a world of front-end frameworks and floods of tools, what if we had a nice CSS alternative?</p>
<p>Hence, I created this toolkit. It works as a library and extends your choice of designs. The toolkit has several design schemes that suits for your specific project needs. And what's more important that
it can be used as Bootstrap theme, for buttons(only). I hope you may find it helpful.</p><br>

*The name is Goggles, because a goggle, being in various colors, it redefines a person's looks - just as buttons do in the realm of web.*
